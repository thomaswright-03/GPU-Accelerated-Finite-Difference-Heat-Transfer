🌡️ GPU-Accelerated Heat-Transfer Simulation Project:
A Python toolkit for solving 1-D and 2-D transient heat-conduction problems using explicit finite-difference methods with:
    CPU (NumPy) solvers
    GPU vectorised solvers (CuPy)
    GPU custom CUDA C kernels (CuPy RawKernel)

Designed for experimentation, visualisation, and benchmarking the performance of different numerical implementations.

🚀 Features:
    1-D and 2-D explicit heat-diffusion solvers
    Custom temperature discontinuities via config dictionaries
    Neumann (insulated) boundary conditions
    Dirichlet fixed-temperature points
    Export final temperature fields to CSV
    Modular structure for future extensions (GPU, animations, measurement 'probe' plots)


🧠 Running a Simulation:
    Configure .venv with python 3.12 or newer and run:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    This project includes GPU-accelerated solvers implemented using CuPy (vectorised kernels) and CUDA RawKernel (custom CUDA C kernels). Therefore, an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit versions compatible with CuPy are required.
    
    Modify config1D or config2D in main.py, and select solver functions, then run:

        python main.py

    with desired solver function calls uncommented

    The run functions output:
        Final temperature field
        Temperature history
        Runtime
        CSV export to the rawdata/ folder

    Then, uncomment/call desired plot functions which plot:
        A heatmap
        A scatter graph of a specified temperature point


Configuration Format (example):
    
    config2D = {
        "alpha": 1.12e-04,
        "dt": 0.001,
        "dx": 0.01,
        "dims": 2,
        "t_steps": 100000,
        "x_size": 0.1,
        "T": 25,

        "temp_deltas": {
            (0.01, 0.01): 116,
            (0, 0.01): 90,
            (0.01, 0): 100
        }
    }


⚠️ WARNINGS:
    Boundary Behaviour and Corner Node Restriction (2D Solver):
        The 2D heat solver uses:
            Explicit finite-difference update
            Interior-only CUDA kernel
            Neumann (zero-flux) boundary conditions applied after each timestep
            
        Because of this combination, the four corner nodes do not participate in the finite-difference update. The boundaries are overwritten during the Neumann update step, so any fixed-temperature delta placed exactly at a corner will be replaced before it can influence neighbouring cells.

        Valid positions for fixed-temperature sources:
            Fixed-temperature points may be placed on edges, but not in the four corners:
                (0, 0) → invalid
                (0, L) → invalid
                (L, 0) → invalid
                (L, L) → invalid
            
            Instead place the heat source one point diagonally inwards i.e:
                (dx, dx) → valid
    
    GPU Requiremnts:
        This project requires an NVIDIA GPU with:
            CuPy installed with a CUDA-matched build (cupy-cuda12x)
            CUDA Toolkit 12.4 or later installed locally
        
    If a GPU is not detected, the CPU solver still works.

📊 Performance Testing:
    perform_plotter.py performs a controlled runtime comparison of:
        
        CPU (NumPy)
        GPU CuPy (vectorised)
        GPU CUDA C kernels
    
    with identical physics and varying grid sizes (N²).

    It automatically:
        
        loads config_data.csv
        runs multiple solvers
        records their runtimes
        generates a performance figure

To-Do / Future Updates
    Add animation of heat propagation
    Add configurable boundary-condition types
    Add mesh-grid visualisation
    Add automated stability check
    Add logging & progress bars
